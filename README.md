# django_crepway

Python project with django framework with stripe for the passage of my bachelor 


## Description of my project

my project is on an e-commerce responsive site to order in book or on site and to take away. Once the order has been placed via a delivery form and payment has been received, an invoice is sent to the customer's email and to the company's email. Then the invoice and the customer details are automatically printed.
